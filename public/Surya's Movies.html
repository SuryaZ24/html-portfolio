<h1>The Best Movies According to Surya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>This has been, is and always will be my #1 favorite movie of all
time. This is probably when Pixar put in the most amount of effort
in their projects, and it shows. The characters, the writing, the animation, the 
plot; all of it flows extremely well with each other. And a lot of messages
are to be learned from here.

<h3>Robots</h3>
<p>
Great voice acting and engagement, also has a few adult jokes here and there.
</p>

<h3>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</h3>
<p>
Extremely well done animation for years to come out of an action anime movie.
